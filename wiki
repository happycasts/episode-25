taglist plugin is not so useful

# usr_29.txt

    ptag markdown
    pclose

Ctrl-] or Ctrl-W-] can do sth similiar but not so nicely

What is a tag?  It is a location where an identifier is defined. 

`psearch popen` can get the definition of popen in stdio.h, even tough popen is not listed in `tags` file
this can be super useful, if I can use sth like `psearch render`?

    ctags -R --exclude=.git --exclude=log * ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-head/*
    ctags --extra=+f --exclude=.git --exclude=log -R * `rvm gemdir`/gems/*
